## Ferry Boat
During the second term of the first year, I developed this [Ferry Boat](ferry.zip) in C++ as part of the coursework for this module.
<br>I also created a UML Class Diagram which can be found [here](Ferry_UMLv2.pdf).

## Darts
During the second term of the first year, I developed this [501 Darts Game](Darts.zip) in C++ as my final project for this module.
<br>A [PDF Report](Darts-Report.pdf) and a [UML Class Diagram](Darts-UML.pdf) were also created to help understanding my approach.
<br>Grade: A+
